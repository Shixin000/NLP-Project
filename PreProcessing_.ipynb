I'm always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \\n\\nTravis's greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it's evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it's really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \\n\\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It's also worth noting that he didn't fry my hair -- something that I've had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout & style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \\n\\nTravis, I will see you every single time I'm out in Vegas.  You make me feel beauuuutiful!\",\n"," \"I have to say that this office really has it together, they are so organized and friendly!  Dr. J. Phillipp is a great dentist, very friendly and professional.  The dental assistants that helped in my procedure were amazing, Jewel and Bailey helped me to feel comfortable!  I don't have dental insurance, but they have this insurance through their office you can purchase for $80 something a year and this gave me 25% off all of my dental work, plus they helped me get signed up for care credit which I knew nothing about before this visit!  I highly recommend this office for the nice synergy the whole office has!\",\n"," \"Went in for a lunch.

Very happy with her.\\n\\nIn summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!\",\n"," 'Today was my second out of three sessions I had paid for. Although my first session went well, I could tell Meredith had a particular enjoyment for her male clients over her female. However, I returned because she did my teeth fine and I was pleased with the results. When I went in today, I was in the whitening room with three other gentlemen. My appointment started out well, although, being a person who is in the service industry, I always attend to my female clientele first when a couple arrives. Unbothered by those signs, I waited my turn. She checked on me once after my original 30 minute timer to ask if I was ok. She attended my boyfriend on numerous occasions, as well as the other men, and would exit the room without even asking me or looking to see if I had any irritation. Half way through, another woman had showed up who she was explaining the deals to in the lobby. While she admits timers must be reset half way through the process, she reset my boyfriends, left, rest the gentleman furthest away from me who had time to come in, redeem his deal, get set, and gave his timer done, before me, then left, and at this point my time was at 10 minutes. So, she should have reset it 5 minutes ago, according to her. While I sat there patiently this whole time with major pain in my gums, i watched the time until the lamp shut off. Not only had she reset two others, explained deals to other guest, but she never once checked on my time. When my light turned off, I released the stance of my mouth to a more relaxed state, assuming I was only getting a thirty minute session instead of the usual 45, because she had yet to come in. At this point, the teeth formula was not only burning the gum she neglected for 25 minutes now, but it began to burn my lips. I began squealing and slapping my chair trying to get her attention from the other room in a panic. I was in so much pain, that by the time she entered the room I was already out of my chair. She finally then acknowledged me, and asked if she could put vitamin E on my gum burn (pictured below). At this point, she has treated two other gums burns, while neglecting me, and I was so irritated that I had to suffer, all I wanted was to leave. While I waited for my boyfriend, she kept harassing me about the issue. Saying, \"well burns come with teeth whitening.\" While I totally agree, and under justifiable circumstances would not be as irritate, it could have easily been avoid if she had checked on me even a second time, so I could let her know. Not only did she never check on my physical health, she couldn\\'t even take two seconds to reset the timer, which she even admitted to me. Her accuse was that she was coming in to do it, but I had the light off for a solid two minutes before I couldn\\'t stand the pain. She admitted it should be reset every 15 minutes, which means for 25 minutes she did not bother to help me at all. Her guest in the lobby then proceeded to attack me as well, simply because I wanted to leave after the way I was treated. I also expected a refund for not getting a complete session today, due to the neglect, and the fact I won\\'t be returning for my last, she had failed to do that. She was even screaming from the door, and continued to until my boyfriend and I were down the steps. I have never in my life been more appalled by a grown woman\\'s behavior, who claims to be in the business for \"10 years.\" Admit your wrongs, but don\\'t make your guest feel unwelcome because you can\\'t do you job properly.',\n"," 'I\\'ll be the first to admit that I was not excited about going to La Tavolta. Being a food snob, when a group of friends suggested we go for dinner I looked online at the menu and to me there was nothing special and it seemed overpriced.  Im also not big on ordering pasta when I go out. Alas, I was outnumbered. Thank goodness! I ordered the sea bass special. It was to die for. Cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, perfect portion. I can not say enough good things about this dish. When the server asked how it was he seemed very proud of the dish and said, \" doesn\\'t she (the chef) do an incredible job?\" She does. \\n\\nMy hubby got the crab tortellini and also loved his. I heard \"mmmm this is so good\" from all around the table. Our waiter was super nice and even gave us free desserts because we were some of the last people in the restaurant. Service was very slow and the place was PACKED but we had our jugs of wine and a large group with good conversation so it didn\\'t seem to bother anyone.\\n\\nSo-\\n\\nDo order the calamari and fried zucchini appetizers. Leave out the mussels. \\n\\nIf they have the sea bass special, I highly recommend it. The chicken parm and crab tortellini were also very good and very big. The chicken Romano was a bit bland. The house salads were teeny. \\n\\nDo make a reservation but still expect to wait for your food. Go with a large group of people and plan for it to be loud. Don\\'t go with a date unless you\\'re fighting and don\\'t feel like hearing anything they have to say.  Ask to sit in the side room if it\\'s available.',\n"," \"Tracy dessert had a big name in Hong Kong and the one in First Markham place has been here for many years now! \\n\\nCame in for some Chinese dessert, and I must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years. I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!\\n\\nA simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side. \\n\\nI also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it! \\n\\nI'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished.\",\n"," \"This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality\\n\\nMany of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.\\n\\nThe service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.\\n\\nIt's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options.\",\n"," 'I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The \"Man O\\'War\" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. \\nThe only big miss on their beers I\\'ve had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  \\nNonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn\\'t had from them would be top notch... and they are! \\nThe reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! \\nThe servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! \\nAfter another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. \\nThis is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn\\'t seem very pleased when leaving. \\nThe toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.',\n"," \"It's a giant Best Buy with 66 registers.

 go with a date unless you are  fighting and do not  feel like hearing anything they have to say  ask to sit in the side room if it is  available',\n"," 'tracy dessert had a big name in hong kong and the one in first markham place has been here for many years now   came in for some chinese dessert and i must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years i might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well the waitress gave us tea which i could taste had red date in it fancy  a simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like  or something basically all the desserts were more than  that has  crazy i can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl it would probably cost like  a few years ago i think i can still get it for like  which is more reasonable but wow  more than  is a little over the top for this dessert though i must say it is tracy dessert and they are a little more on the expensive side   i also saw other items on the menu like fish balls chicken wings shaved ice my friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it   i am  also surprised how many people come to tracy dessert after work we came on a sunday and the tables were always filled i think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished',\n"," 'this place has gone down hill  clearly they have cut back on staff and food quality  many of the reviews were written before the menu changed  i have  been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill  the service is slow  my salad which was  was as bad as it gets  it is  just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options',\n"," 'i was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers the man  of war quickly became my favorite dipa the rusulka vanilla stout is a good thick sweet stout and the ironclad is a top notch ipa  the only big miss on their beers i have  had is the big chuck barleywine it could probably benefit greatly with age but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol   nonetheless i had enough to convince me that the other beers i had not  had from them would be top notch and they are  the reason for the  stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers they obviously know their craft well  the servers are great and friendly but relying on two servers to wait on  customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be in fact after waiting  mins at a dirty table i was finally able to track down someone i guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there  after another  mins the gm finally stopped over to take our drink order the smugness of this guy was amazing the thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head  this is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the nonfinal check left by the party before us who did not  seem very pleased when leaving  the toast  cheese was good but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing',\n"," 'it is  a giant best buy with  registers  i do not  get it  what is  the big deal about this place',\n"," 'like walking back in time every saturday morning my sister and i was in a bowling league and after we were done we had  spend a few quarters playing the pin ball machines until our mother came to pick us up  my sister was daring and play the machines hard she was afraid of that tilt showing up and freezing the game  i on the other hand was a bit more gentler and wanted to make sure i got my quarter has  worth  this place has rows and rows of machines some are really old and some are more of a mid  has  theme  there is even a ms pac man  it was fun to spend an afternoon playing the machines and remembering all the fun of my early teen years',\n"," 'walked in around  on a friday afternoon we sat at a table just off the bar and walked out after  min or so do not  even think they realized we walked in however everyone at the bar noticed we walked in service was non existent at best not a good way for a new business to start out oh well the location they are at has been about  different things over the past several years so they will just be added to the list smdh',\n"," 'wow  so surprised at the one and two star reviews  we started with the most tender calamari although the marinara sauce was a bit bland but a touch of salt made it just right my husband had the veal with peppers and said it was so delicious and tender the mashed potatoes were perfect i had the salmon diablo which was also delicious our salad was beautiful dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount we ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu our server matt was right on very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu our appetizer salad and entrees were timed perfectly i love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while i was still eating it no problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably  i wonder sometimes if people just do not  appreciate relaxing and taking time to eat a wonderful and beautifully prepared meal  a wonderful atmosphere so relaxing the chairs are super comfortable too we will certainly be back  give it a try  do not   always go by the reviews  a bottle of riesling calamari app two delicious entrees and dessert for   well with it',\n"," 'michael from red carpet vip is amazing  i reached out because i needed help planning my soon to be sister in law has  bachelorette it was a group of  girls so i was a little overwhelmed but michael saved the day everything was super smooth and easy we got good deals and had the best time ever we booked hotel and a bachelorette package for a great price i have saved contact info because i will for sure reach out again on next vegas trip',\n"," 'i can not  believe how things have changed in  years i picked up duck congee sometime in the winter when my hubby was sick  i was very disappointed because the ginger fish sauce tasted like it had gone bad it should never be bitter  today my hubby wanted to eat there since he was craving the duck congee and most places do not  serve the duck  coleslaw side we waited about  minutes to get our menu  after we placed our orders we waited another  minutes to get the tea that most places bring with the menu  i could go on with the details but the gist of the story is they were understaffed or the staff was slow  the worst part of it was that the service  the servers make us feel bad for asking for anything like when they took our order  we had arrived and placed our order before another couple bside us at least  minutes ahead but somehow this couple received their pho before mine  they were almost done eating their pho before mine came out',\n"," 'you can not   really find anything wrong with this place the pastas and pizzas are both amazing and high quality the price is very reasonable the owner and the staff are very friendly if you are  in downtown check this place out a lot of people think just because it is  downtown there are lots of options around but that has  not always the case as there is also a lot of poor quality food in downtown as well',\n"," 'great lunch today staff was very helpful in assisting with selections and knowledgeable on the ingredients we enjoyed the bbq chicken with tika masala sauce and really good naan bread the biryani with chicken was also yummy fun to see the food being prepared in the tandoori ovens great addition to the fast casual scene in cleveland',\n"," 'i love chinese food and i love mexican food what can go wrong a couple of things first things first this place is more of a rice bowl kind of place i thought it was going to be more diverse as far as the menu goes but its mainly rice bowls you get with different kinds of meats the ordering was a little confusing at first but one of the employees helped us out and i got the item bowl and got the jade chicken and hengrenade chicken with all ricejerk i also ordered a jade chicken quesadilla on the side  i am  gonna admit this place looks kinda dirty i do not  think arizona uses those health department letter grade system like california does but if i were to just judge by how it looked inside i had  give it a c grade lol we waited for about  minutes or so and finally got our food we took it to go and ate at our hotel room   mmmm the food was just alright the jade chicken was nothing special it tasted like any generic chinese fast food orange chickensesame chicken variant the hengrenade chicken although was the less spicier version of the jerk chicken was still pretty spicy for me just be warned the jerk chicken is super spicy if you are not  sure ask for a sample at the restaurant before ordering but it was way too spicy for me   the jade chicken quesadilla was decent but nothing special just imagine orange chicken in between a tortilla and cheese a friend of mine ordered a jade chicken burrito and we were confused when we pulled it out of the bag because it was literally the size of mcdonald has  apple pie if you order the burrito be warned that it is  a burrito for gnomes and smurfs but he said it was tasty   they provide a snicker doodle sugar cookie for each meal and it was decent again nothing special   not gonna lie the next day my stomach felt like a little mexican dude and chinese dude were wrestling and throwing molotov cocktails inside i used the bathroom like  times i do not  recommend eating this place if you have a lot to do the next day',\n"," 'we have  been a huge slim has  fan since they opened one up in texas about two years ago when we used to live there this place never disappoints they even have great salads and grilled chicken plus they have fresh brewed sweet tea it is  the best',\n"," 'good selection of classes of beers and mains i have  been here twice  first time i had the fried chicken it was delicious but be warned extremely salty i could not  even finish the last piece of chicken after experiencing a salt overload  second time we came on a wednesday we did not  know it was bbq night where they have a completely different menu and do not  offer anything from their original vegetarianfriendly menu this menu has one vegetarianfriendly option  an eggplant sandwich the vegetarian in my party said it was awful also on bbq night you choose  sides except they were out of all their sides except   fries and potato salad i can not   say i was thrilled to have carb heavy sides with my carb heavy main how do you run out of sides so early in the evening  service not so great  i had  avoid coming here on
